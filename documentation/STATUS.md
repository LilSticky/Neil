## Current slice

Slice 002 "Look up a player" (branch `002-look-up-a-player`): spec, plan and tasks written ([spec.md](../specs/002-look-up-a-player/spec.md), [plan.md](../specs/002-look-up-a-player/plan.md)). Slice 001 "Greet the test server" is done (PRs #2, #3): Neil runs on Wispbyte from a green
`main` through the `deploy` branch, answers `/ping` on the test server, and its data folder survives
restarts and redeploys (ADR 5 stands). Details: [tasks.md](../specs/001-greet-the-test-server/tasks.md),
[HOSTING.md](HOSTING.md). Neil is the only bot application; local runs need Wispbyte stopped.

**Next step:** T001 in [tasks.md](../specs/002-look-up-a-player/tasks.md) (record fixtures), on branch
`002-look-up-a-player`.

## Known broken / WIP

None.

## Open questions

See [discovery/initial.md](discovery/initial.md#open-questions): which Discord roles exist and which Neil
may manage (needed by slice 005); (Wispbyte's disk persistence: answered yes in slice 001.)

## Standing notes

- Sessions wrap up before the plan limit: `.claude/hooks/usage-guard.mjs` tells a session once, at 95% of the
  5-hour or 7-day usage (`NEIL_USAGE_WRAP_UP`), to commit, update STATUS, push and stop.
- The Game API's limit is a daily quota (2,000/UTC day on our patron key), not a per-second limit; see ADR 4. The key is
  `LAP_TRACKER_API_KEY` in `.env` (git-ignored; template in `env.example`). Code uses only the endpoints
  verified in [GAME-API.md](GAME-API.md).
